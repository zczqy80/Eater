## Introduction to Application

The app is called "On-time Eater" and is a mobile app designed to help users manage their eating habits. The app allows users to better understand and control their eating habits by recording when and where they eat. The On-time Eater is characterized by its intuitive user interface and rich features, such as automatically calculating the time interval since the last meal(pub.dev, 2024) to remind users to eat in time. 

In addition, the app can also provide weather information based on the user's geographical location information(pub.dev, 2024), helping users adjust their food choices according to the weather(OpenWeatherMap, 2024). All of the user's data is securely stored, and even if the app is closed and reopened, the past record can be seen at a glance. Through the app, users can arrange their daily meals more scientifically and promote a healthy life.

In addition, the app has been designed with a number of user-friendly action reminder pop-ups. For example, after the completion of the record, user can go directly to the data page or return to the home page, and when deleting the record data, user will be asked to confirm again to prevent misconduct.
