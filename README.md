##  1.Home page and subpage creation

As mentioned in the introduction section, the main page has four interactive buttons that lead to the Record, Suggestion, Database, and Settings subpages. The first three buttons are located in the lower middle of the main page, and the Settings sub-page button is in the upper right corner of the screen. The effect of the main page is shown in the following figure:

The remaining 4 sub-pages do not add functional modules now, and the module function of the record page is planned to be added in the next update. The effect of the 4 sub-pages is shown below:
